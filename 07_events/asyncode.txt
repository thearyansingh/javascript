// javascript ---- synchronous
               ------ single threaded

 //    execution context 
 --------- execute one line of code at a time 
         ->> each operation waits for the last  one to complete the operation

Blocking code  vs non blocking code 

block the flow of program-- read file sync
does not block execution-- read file Async
